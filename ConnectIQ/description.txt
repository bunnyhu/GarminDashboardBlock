This is a garmin Edge cycling computer data field. Its purpose is to display more data in one place, overcoming the limitations of the factory one-block/one-data split. I didn't want a full screen solution though, because I use other ConnectIQ data fields already from other developers, which unfortunately can't be inserted into a custom screen.

My data field displays 3 sizes of slightly different data, adapted to my own needs. The 2x2 big size is my main choice, the 2x1 line I use under the map, and the 1x1 is just why not make it.

current speed
average speed
current cadence
climb %
heart rate & zones
compass
wind direction
radar speed
distance travelled
moving time

Enhanced data fields
current speed - Its color marked: Green if the current speed is the same or faster than the average speed. Yellow if it is slower but not more than 1km/h or 1Mi/h, and orange if it is even slower than that. Also there is a triangled decimal dot, that show our speed is faster or slower than average (for color blinds or just simple a second sign).

climb % - It is calculated from measured data, if slope the number is negative.

heart rate zones - Color coded (same colors like Connect) zone bar.

compass , wind , radar speed - Those data using the same place and changing dinamic.
Default is the compass. If there is weather informations the wind direction also appers on the circle around the compass. If there is fresh wind data - we using it, anyway if we are offline and it is more than one hour old, it start use the hourly forecast. The weather information coming from factory Garmin provided data.
If we have radar and wehicle(s) arriving, it show the fastest one's speed replaced the compass place. If the speed moderate the number in a green circle, the ok speed means yellow and the fast one with red circle. After the wehicle pass, we turn back to compass.
